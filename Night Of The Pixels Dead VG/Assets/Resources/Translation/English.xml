  <!--REPORT SOLDIER-->
  <text  ReportTitle ="WRITTEN REPORT" />
  <text  ReportPage1 ="June 16, 2:23 pm - Due to an accident with the car, I found myself asking for hospitality in this house, unfortunately I left my tape recorder in the car and my radio also suffered a breakdown, so I don't I was able to call for backup. The Bancroft family was attacked shortly after my arrival by their neighbor, Mr. Kimmel." />
  <text  ReportPage2 ="He knocked on the door and Mrs. Bancroft, after opening it, was bitten on the arm. Mr. Kimmel, an unprecedented middle-aged white man (according to what I have been witnessed), was forcibly removed by Mr. Bancroft (US general off duty), the undersigned pulled out the weapon, ordering the attacker to surrender." />
  <text  ReportPage3 ="Despite the constant requests, Mr. Kimmel did not mention the surrender, for this I had to intervene by firing three shots in the leg, but he still did not seem to stop, consequently I had to fire three more shots on the chest, but still nothing. It seemed that the blows inflicted had no effect, despite being unprotected." />
  <text  ReportPage4 ="At this point Mr. Kimmel's wife and son entered, also with a slow pace and emitting like a verse, given by a single syllable and outside the house there seemed to be other people in the same state, still unidentified. Mr. Bancroft asked me for protection as he made his way to the fireplace, I didn't pay attention to the intensity of the moment to his movements, but he opened a passage in it." />
  <text  ReportPage5 ="We took refuge in an underground bunker built by Mr. Bancroft's father in the mid-60s, for fear of the outbreak of a nuclear war, everything was hidden because it was not in compliance with the law, so I ask for investigations." />
  <text  ReportPage6 ="3:42 pm update - Time seems not to pass and the tension is at its maximum, both Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft would like to go out to head to the hospital, as the medicines in here do not seem to have any effect on the bite it seems generating some sort of infection, also the Bancroft daughter is lost, apparently she was away from home when I arrived. I went to check, all the people were gone, I went to the first floor and found the girl's body right in front of the stairs." />
  <text  ReportPage7 ="At that point I saw Mr. Kimmel pop up from around the corner of the corridor and I fled (I ran out of gun ammo). I didn't say anything to the Bancroft gentlemen, I don't want the situation to escalate. I'm seeing Mr. Bancroft's confidence begin to falter to make room for fear and pain. The color of the wife has started to turn white, moreover the arm seems to have undergone a kind of mutation and the fever seems to increase, now we are preparing to go to the hospital, hop [the note stops]" />

  <!--sallyHomeworkTitle-->
  <text  sallyHomeworkTitle ="HOMEWORK FOR SCHOOL" />
  <text  sallyHomeworkPage1 ="21 years ago my dad found himself fighting for our homeland in Vietnam, for me he is a hero, because he took his responsibilities and to protect not only my mom, but every single American, he went in a distant land to stop the people who otherwise would have killed us. I see many people who point to him as a murderer or as a madman, because sometimes with sudden noises he tends to look around or take shelter in a corner, but I know that for him all this is just a burden," />
  <text  sallyHomeworkPage2 ="I hear him at night as he moans or wakes up screaming, while my mom tries to calm him down. When he sees me standing there in front of the door of their room, he takes me (or rather he took me by now considering my age) and takes me back to the room, tucks me up and tries to make me feel safe, tries to do it whenever he can. Could such a person be a killer? P.s. I found a picture of him just back from the war, it makes me strange to see him so young and without long hair" />
